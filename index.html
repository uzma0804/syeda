                    <p class="lead mb-5">
                        <p>I am a Data Visualization and HCI researcher with a <b>PhD in Computer Science from the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University</b>. During my doctoral studies, I was a member (now an alumna) of the <a href="https://vis.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Vis Lab </a> at Northeastern University, where I worked under the supervision of my advisor <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/michelle-borkin/">Dr. Michelle A. Borkin. </a></p>

                        <p>My primary research interest lies at the intersection of Data Visualization and HCI, particularly with a focus on theories and methods of design studies, replication studies, and visualization for social good. My work also extends into visualization evaluations, focusing on user studies and participatory design approaches that center the experiences and perspectives of real users and how they make sense of visualizations in real contexts. My work contributes methods and frameworks that aim to bridge the gap between visualization pedagogy and research and strengthens rigor and reproducibility in the field. I am especially motivated by the challenge of bringing research practices into data visualization classrooms, developing approaches that make design thinking accessible to novice students while preserving the complexity and nuances of real-world design studies and user experience research. </p>

                        <p>I have 6 years of experience leading mixed-methods research and user-centered design processes. Throughout my time at Northeastern University, I taught and mentored over 200 students and orchestrated more than 100 collaborative design projects with both local, and international collaborators, including nonprofits, city councils, educational institutes, and for-profit organizations. I also supervised 10 UX projects in an HCI course, where student teams explored the theme of belongingness on campus. Guiding these projects, through need-finding, interviewing, prototyping, and evaluation allowed me to foster students’ design creativity and help them transform early ideas into thoughtful and well-reasoned final products. My passion for teaching and mentoring is grounded in inclusivity, reflection, and helping students build confidence in navigating the ambiguities of the design process and in connecting their data visualization and HCI knowledge to real-world needs. </p>

                        <p>I am originally from Bangladesh, where I completed my undergraduate studies in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. I enjoy cooking, drawing, reading, and spending time with my family. </p>

The study used 12 children with ASD and 12 control children to investigate their visual behavior in smooth pursuit, saccadic eye movement and face processing mechanisms. The smooth pursuit experiment contained animations of objects moving horizontally across the screen and the saccadic test contained animations of predicable and non-predictable saccades. The third test contained images of seven different emotions. To attain the gaze data, Tobii EyeX Controller was used, and the data was obtained, processed and analyzed in MATLAB.</p>

                            <p>I have collaborated with a local neighborhood association called Chester Square Neighbors to help them with their data and visualization needs through a design study project in a graduate course on Data Visualization (CS 7250 - Information Visualization: Theory and Applications). My team and I volunteered in the neighborhood association to get a better understanding of the problems they faced regarding their neighborhood park that was in the need for renovation and improved facilities, but the association members lacked concrete data-driven evidence to present to the City Council. The design study project in collaboration with the neighborhood association was aimed to provide necessary data-driven visualizations to the community partners in order to facilitate better communication and presentation of the problems they were facing regarding their park, which in turn would help them get the attention from the City council for funding.  </p>   
                      

                   
                          <p>I also volunteered and taught Data Visualization in the Multi-media CS course at Boston Latin Academy by delivering a lecture on “Common mistakes in Data Visualization” and teaching the basics of Tableau.                               </p> 
                                      
                         
                         
                          <p>Earlier in my academic journey I also volunteered at the International Conference on Imaging, Vision & Pattern Recognition (ICIVPR 2017)          and the International conference on Informatics, Electronics and vision conference (ICIEV 2014) </p>
